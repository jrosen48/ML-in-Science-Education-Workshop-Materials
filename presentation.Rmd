# Goals of this workshop

### Over-arching goal:

Get started with applying machine learning methods in relatively short order through the use of R

### Specific aims are to learn about:

- a small but important set of core ideas about machine learning
- how these ideas are instantiated through packages for R, specifically *tidymodels*
- how to conduct a start-to-end machine learning analysis 

### Also: 

This is an opportunity to get to know and learn from one another and to build capacity in science education research to do machine learning

# Agenda

1. Introductions (15 min.)
1. Primer on/review of R and the "Getting Ready for the Workshop" task (15 min.)
1. Overview of foundational machine learning ideas (20 min.) - then a **10 min. break**
1. Introduction to machine learning for a _regression_ problem (20 + 20 min. = 40 min.) - then a **15 min. break**
1. Introduction to machine learning for a _classification_ problem (20 + 10 min. = 30 min.) - then a **5 min. break**
1. A very brief discussion of other uses of machine learning (15 min.)
1. Conclusion and resources to learn and do more and discussion/Q&A (15 min.)

# Break-out rooms!

In randomly assigned break-out rooms of ~5 people, *starting with whomever has a 
birthday nearest to today*:

- **Introduce yourself** and your position and affiliation
- **Describe one thing that you're not good at that you like to do**
- **Describe one thing that you're good at that you don't like to do**
- **Share two words** that capture your attitude toward/beliefs about machine learning 

Be prepared to share your two words with the whole group when we return from break-out rooms.

# What's R?

- R is both **statistical software** that is free, cross-platform, and open-source, and a **programming language**

- It is well-suited to doing data science and machine learning, but it is *not* the only good option
  - Python, in particular, is a good option

- I prefer to use R for a few reasons:
  - It treats data frames (think data stored in a spreadsheet) as a first-class object
  - It is better for the kinds of things that I (and I think many science education researchers) commonly want to do
    - Example: It's non-trivial to find a python module to fit a multi-level/hierarchical linear model; in R, it is an extension of the code to fit a regression model

- RStudio Cloud provides a good environment for teaching and learning R

# R Primer

What questions or reactions did you have to the Getting Ready work in RStudio Cloud?

Let's head over to that and work through it.

# Defining Machine Learning (ML)

- *Artificial Intelligence (AI)*
.footnote[
[1]  I feel super uncomfortable bringing AI into this, but perhaps it's useful just to be clear about terminology
]
: Simulating human intelligence through the use of computers
- *Machine learning (ML)*: A subset of AI focused on how computers acquire new information/knowledge

This definition leaves a lot of space for a range of approaches to ML

# A helpful frame: Supervised & unsupervised

## Supervised ML

- Requires coded data or data with a known outcome
- Uses coded/outcome data to train an algorithm
- Uses that algorithm to **predict the codes/outcomes for new data** (data not used during the training)
- Can take the form of a *classification* (predicting a dichotomous or categorical outcome) or a *regression* (predicting a continuous outcome)
- Algorithms include:
  - Linear regression (really!)
  - Logistic regression
  - Decision tree
  - Support Vector Machine

---

# A helpful frame: Supervised & unsupervised

## Unsupervised ML

- Does not require coded data; one way to think about unsupervised ML is that its purpose is to discover codes/labels
- Is used to discover groups among observations/cases or to summarize across variables
- Can be used in an _exploratory mode_ (see [Nelson, 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0049124118769114?casa_token=EV5XH31qbyAAAAAA%3AFg09JQ1XHOOzlxYT2SSJ06vZv0jG-s4Qfz8oDIQwh2jrZ-jrHNr7xZYL2FwnZtZiokhPalvV1RL2Bw)) 
- **Warning**: The results of unsupervised ML _cannot_ directly be used to provide codes/outcomes for supervised ML techniques 
- Can work with both continuous and dichotomous or categorical variables
- Algorithms include:
  - Cluster analysis
  - Principle Components Analysis (really!)
  - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (topic modeling)

# How do you know what technique to choose?

Do you have coded data or data with a known outcome -- let's say about science students -- and, do you want to:

- _Predict_ how other students with similar data (but without a known outcome) perform?
- _Scale_ coding that you have done for a sample of data to a larger sample?
- _Provide timely or instantaneous feedback_, like in many learning analytics systems?

**Supervised methods may be your best bet**

Do you not yet have codes/outcomes -- and do you want to?

- _Achieve a starting point_ for qualitative coding, perhaps in a ["computational grounded theory"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0049124117729703) mode?
- _Discover groups or patterns in your data_ that may be interesting on their own?
- _Reduce the number of variables in your dataset_ to a smaller, but perhaps nearly as explanatory/predictive - set of variables?

**Unsupervised methods may be helpful**

# Okay, I know what _type_ of method to use

### But, how do I select a particular model?

One general principle is to start with the simplest possible model and to build toward
more complex models as it is helpfuL.
