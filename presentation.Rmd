# Goals of this workshop

### Over-arching goal:

Get started with applying machine learning methods in relatively short order through the use of R

### Specific aims are to learn about:

- a small but important set of core ideas about machine learning
- how these ideas are instantiated through packages for R, specifically *tidymodels*
- how to conduct a start-to-end machine learning analysis 

### Also: 

This is an opportunity to get to know and learn from one another and to build capacity in science education research to do machine learning

# Agenda

1. Introductions (15 min.)
1. Primer on/review of R and the "Getting Ready for the Workshop" task (15 min.)
1. Overview of foundational machine learning ideas (20 min.) - then a **10 min. break**
1. Introduction to machine learning for a _regression_ problem (20 + 20 min. = 40 min.) - then a **15 min. break**
1. Introduction to machine learning for a _classification_ problem (20 + 10 min. = 30 min.) - then a **5 min. break**
1. A very brief discussion of other uses of machine learning (15 min.)
1. Conclusion and resources to learn and do more and discussion/Q&A (15 min.)

# Break-out rooms!

In randomly assigned break-out rooms of ~5 people, *starting with whomever has a 
birthday nearest to today*:

- **Introduce yourself** and your position and affiliation
- **Describe one thing that you're not good at that you like to do**
- **Describe one thing that you're good at that you don't like to do**
- **Share two words** that capture your attitude toward/beliefs about machine learning 

Be prepared to share your two words with the whole group when we return from break-out rooms.

# What's R?

- R is both **statistical software** that is free, cross-platform, and open-source, and a **programming language**

- It is well-suited to doing data science and machine learning, but it is *not* the only good option
  - Python, in particular, is a good option

- I prefer to use R for a few reasons:
  - It treats data frames (think data stored in a spreadsheet) as a first-class object
  - It is better for the kinds of things that I (and I think many science education researchers) commonly want to do
    - Example: It's non-trivial to find a python module to fit a multi-level/hierarchical linear model; in R, it is an extension of the code to fit a regression model

- RStudio Cloud provides a good environment for teaching and learning R
